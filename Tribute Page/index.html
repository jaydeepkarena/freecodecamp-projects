          Iron Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel
          Comics. The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter
          Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his
          first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and received his own
          title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968).

          A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward
          "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt
          to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a powered suit of
          armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding
          weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries.
          He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at
          first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually declared that he was, in fact, Iron
          Man in a public announcement.
